# Docker Files - Moved to Backup

The Docker configuration files have been moved to backup due to:

## Issues with Docker Approach
- **Large image size**: ~6GB due to PyTorch and ML dependencies
- **Expensive**: High storage and transfer costs
- **Slow builds**: Long CI/CD execution times
- **Resource intensive**: High memory usage

## Backup Files
- `Dockerfile.backup` - Original Docker configuration
- `docker-compose.yml.backup` - Original Docker Compose setup

## Current Deployment Strategy
The project now uses Python virtual environments for deployment:
- Faster startup times
- Lower resource usage
- Easier debugging and maintenance
- Better cost efficiency

## If You Need Docker Later
To re-enable Docker:
1. Restore the backup files: `mv Dockerfile.backup Dockerfile`
2. Optimize the image size using:
   - CPU-only PyTorch: `torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`
   - Multi-stage builds
   - Distroless base images
   - Model caching strategies

## Alternative Container Solutions
- Use lightweight base images (python:3.11-slim-bullseye)
- Consider model serving platforms (TorchServe, TensorFlow Serving)
- Use cloud-native ML services that handle infrastructure automatically
